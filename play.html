    <h5> Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W. </h5>

     <p>
        ALGERNON.
        Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
        <br>
        LANE.
        I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
        play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
        piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.
        <br>
        LANE.
        Yes, sir.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
        sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
        <br>
        LANE.
        Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the
        way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
        Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
        champagne are entered as having been consumed.
        <br>
        LANE.
        Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
        drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.
        <br>
        LANE.
        I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
        observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
        first-rate brand.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
        <br>
        LANE.
        I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
        experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married
        once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
        a young person.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        [Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
        life, Lane.
        <br>
        LANE.
        No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
        myself.
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
        <br>
        LANE.
        Thank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]
        <br>
        ALGERNON.
        Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
        don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
        seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
