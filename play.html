            Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h3>
            I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
            play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
            piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.

        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            Yes, sir.

            And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
            sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            Yes, sir.

            Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
            Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
            champagne are entered as having been consumed.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h3>
            Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
            drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
            observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
            first-rate brand.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h3>
            Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
            experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married
            once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
            a young person.

            I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
            life, Lane.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
            myself.
        </p>
        <p class="speech"> 
            <h3 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h3>
            Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="LANE">LANE.</h3>
            Thank you, sir.

            Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
            don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
            seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
